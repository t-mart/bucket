[![Tests](https://github.com/t-mart/bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/t-mart/bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Excavator](https://github.com/t-mart/bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/t-mart/bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml)

This is my [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) bucket. There are others like it, but this one is mine.

It provides manifests for some software that I haven't been able to find in the official buckets.

Created from <https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/BucketTemplate>.
